# üöó Predicting Methane Absorption in Porous Materials

[In Silico Design of 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Methane Storage Applications](https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2018.0003/v2) introduces a comprehensive database of 69,840 covalent organic frameworks (COFs), each virtually assembled from 666 unique organic linkers and synthesized via four distinct methods. Using grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations, the study evaluated the methane storage capacity of these frameworks, identifying top-performing materials, outperforming the best methane storage materials currently available.

[This competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predicting-methane-absorption-in-porous-material/) provides participants with a practical opportunity to explore machine learning by analyzing and modeling a real-world dataset. Participants will apply ML techniques to uncover patterns and develop predictive models for COFs' methane storage capacity. The full dataset is available on [Materials Cloud](https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2018.0003/v2).

## üèÜ Kaggle Competition

### Evaluation

Submissions will be evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, a common metric for regression tasks. This measures the average squared difference between the predicted methane storage capacities (`highUptake_mol`) and the actual values in the test set. Lower values of MSE indicate better model performance.

#### Submission File

Your submission must include predictions for the `highUptake_mol` variable for each ID in the test set. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```csv
id,highUptake_mol
1,10.234
2,15.678
3,9.876
...
```

Please ensure that the `id` column in the submission corresponds to the ID from the test dataset, and that the predictions in the `highUptake_mol` column are in the same order. Submissions without the correct format or missing columns will not be accepted.

### Dataset Description

The dataset is derived from the study *[In Silico Design of 2D and 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Methane Storage Applications](https://archive.materialscloud.org/record/2018.0003/v2)*, which presents a database of 69,840 COFs, designed using 666 unique organic linkers and evaluated with four synthesis methods. Grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate methane storage, highlighting COFs that surpass the performance of existing materials.

Participants will leverage this dataset to develop predictive models, advancing the design of high-performing COFs for methane storage applications.
